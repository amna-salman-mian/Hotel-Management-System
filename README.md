# Hotel-Management-System

Project title: Hotel Management System
Project description: The aim of this project is to 
design a hotel management system for running a hotel 
business. The system should be as flexible as possible 
so that it can be used for different hotels.  
A hotel is a hive of operations that include front desk,
 booking and reservations, banquets, finance, HR, 
inventory, material management, quality management, 
security, energy management, housekeeping, and others.
 All these operations occur at the same time, making 
manual management impossible.
